# TextAnalyzer
This  is a django-based tool for analyzing text.

I've used bootstrap for styling the page and django for the backend. 
This  is  a basic text analzing tool which helps you with
1. Removeing punctuations form your given string.
2. Removing extra space from the string
3. Capitalizing your text.
4. Counting the characters in a string
5. Removing new lines from the string.

And a basic blog page with and About us.

I would love if someone  will imporve this code.....

Have a good day  @web development.
